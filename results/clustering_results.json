    "code_9809.py": "Detects the formation of a new amide functional group in the final step of a synthesis (depth <= 1). The check confirms an amide is present in the product but absent from all reactants.",
    "code_9820.py": "This function detects if the synthesis involves a trifluoromethyl-containing substrate\nthat remains unchanged throughout the synthesis.",
    "code_9841.py": "Detects if a cyano group is present in the target molecule and also in at least one of its precursor molecules. This acts as a proxy to identify routes where the cyano group is carried over from an earlier stage, rather than being introduced in the final step.",
    "code_9846.py": "Detects late-stage (final 3 steps) functionalization of a carbonyl group (ketone or aldehyde).\nA reaction is flagged if it matches a known carbonyl transformation from `CARBONYL_FUNCTIONALIZATION_RXNS`,\nor if a reactant carbonyl is consumed to form a product functional group listed in `CARBONYL_FUNCTIONALIZATION_PRODUCTS`.",
    "code_9854.py": "Detects if at least one Cbz-protected molecule is present at every depth of the synthesis. This is checked by identifying the Cbz group via a specific SMARTS pattern in all reactants and products.",
    "code_9972.py": "This function detects if the synthesis uses a convergent approach where\ncomplex fragments are combined in late-stage reactions."
